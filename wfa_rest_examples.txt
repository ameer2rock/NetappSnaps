The Chrome Advanced REST client works well for testing and developing WFA workflows.
For POST requests, XML output can be pasted into the payload.  GET requests return the direct WFA output.

To set the authorization header string (required for POST or GET), enter a header value named "Authorization".  Enter a valid username and password, and create with basic encoding.

#get a list of all available workflows for WFA (means it has been marked "ready for production" to get on the list)
